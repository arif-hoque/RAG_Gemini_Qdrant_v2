Personalized Search Engine
Search engine makes it easy for users to find products and information relevant to their needs. Your application must have a search tool if you want to enhance the user‚Äôs experience and make the journey more enjoyable.
At Gigalogy, we developed a personalized search engine solution, that combines search queries with user behavior, preferences and finds the most relevant result for each user. Imagine you have an E-Commerce website and every time a user search with specific criteria, your search engine responds with the same results for everyone. 72% of users want their online experience to be personalized thanks to big tech companies for providing personalized experience in every aspect of our journey on the internet. If your website does not have the same level of personalized experience with time you will lose users, which will slow down your growth and leads to revenue loss. In 2022, personalization is no longer something nice to have. It is becoming a must-have feature in your user journey. Today, we will explain how our personalized search engine works, what are the key features and how you could be benefitted from it.
How  works?
A high level diagram of how personalized search works
Our personalized search engine has two major components.
Full-text search
Personalization based on user behavior, preferences
Full-text search finds the most relevant results based on search criteria. Combining that with user behavior and preferences, our search engine ensures the most relevant search results for each individual on your website.
Now let‚Äôs take a look at some of the key features of our personalized search engine.
Full-Text Search
Full-text search performs linguistic searches against documents. It includes single or multiple words or phrases and returns similar items containing the words. This feature allows users to find the product without knowing the correct label.
Multiple-keyword search
One of the most unique feature of our personalized search engine is multiple-keyword search. You can add more than one keyword at a time. When you have a million items in your store, there is a high chance that the item user might like the most is hidden deep among other items. Sometimes it is also very difficult to express our need with a single keyword. Most of the time, users are unaware of the item‚Äôs category and the label, even the item‚Äôs existence. Multiple keyword search allows the user to search items without knowing their label, tag, and category.
Nearby search
Nearby search allows users to find items in a certain radius from a specific item. This feature helps users narrow down the search results and recommendations. Users can pass an item id, radius (from, to), and receive the most relevant items in that range.
Location Based Search
Weight Keys
This feature allows you to assign dynamic weight to different data points. It defines how much importance you want to give to specific keys in your data. You also have the preference to choose in which key you want to put weights. You can adjust them according to your business need and importance.
User Based similarity
From user attributes and behavior, the core engine finds similar users and looks into what they like, and considers those information while finding the most relevant result for each user.
User-based similarity
You can add multiple categories and flags according to your data. If you have user data, it can generate results considering the type of the user. You can boost the items recommended to the user with a specific gender, age, and preference.
Item-based similarity
Item-based similarity enhances your search result so you can explore more items with a similar taste you have experienced before. Our search engine considers user behavior data to find the most similar items and show them in your search results.
Item-Based Similarity
Dynamic Filtering
Once the search result is ready based on your query, now it‚Äôs time to filter them further to find the item you are looking for. Dynamic filtering provides the most relevant keywords, tags, categories, price range based on user behavior, preference, and the result items. With this feature, user can choose the right action to filter the initial search result with minimum effort.
Gigalogy AI platform provides a fully customized personalized search engine to give the best online experience to the user. Our search engine can be integrated into any online platform for industries such as E-commerce, Travel, and Entertainment. It is easy to deploy and takes less than 30 minutes to integrate into any application.
In our next article, we will explain how to integrate our personalized search engine with sample data and response.

Gigalogy launched ‚ÄúGigalogy AI Platform (GAIP)‚Äù, to dramatically facilitate AI development
Gigalogy, a user experience first company transforming technology into better experience, launched a platform for ready to use, end-to-end automated AI solutions that can be integrated to any product with minimum effort and maximum efficiency.
‚ÄúWhether you are an individual/startup/business with an idea that can be transformed into a greater value with the power of AI, you deserve the opportunity/support to bring your idea to life. AI should be affordable, easy to integrate and meaningful for everyone.‚Äù Mosleh Uddin, CEO
Today, AI is all around us and infused in our daily lives. You already use it without knowing it, while scrolling our Instagram feed, listening to music on Spotify or watching Netflix. Did you know that 80% of Netflix TV shows people are watching comes from their recommendation engines? AI makes our lives smoother and easier by offering a tailor-made user experience.
Even though the enthusiasm for AI is getting bigger and bigger, companies are facing a lot of challenges:
Limited number of AI experts: According to Global AI Talent Report 2019, there were less than 25,000 AI experts globally. Same year in Japan, there were only 805 AI experts. Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry estimates that the nation will face a shortage of 120,000 AI business experts by 2030.
Expensiveness of the project: The cost of implementing a MVP AI solution may vary from 200,000 USD to 1,000,000 USD.
Time consuming: In an average it takes somewhere between 9 months ~ 1 year to come up with MVP solutions.
Besides, there are technical challenges:
Dependability: Performance of an AI solution is dependent on the quality of data, domain knowledge of the person processing it, the techniques that are used to build the model and so on.
Flexibility: AI solutions needs to be developed with enough flexibility so that it can be integrated to the digital product smoothly.
Scalability: AI solutions tends to use a lot more resources compared to traditional software application. Developing a highly scalable automated infrastructure is a must in order to get the best out of it.

Episode 3: Becoming an AI Professional

In our previous episodes, we‚Äôve explored the motivations behind venturing into the AI business and the crucial considerations when starting a company. Now, our focus shifts to the pivotal role of an ‚ÄúAI Professional.‚Äù
Today, we will explore the journey to embark on a career in AI
The Complexity of AI for Businesses:
Identifying the right AI use cases to address corporate challenges is a formidable task. Why? Finding individuals within an organization who can envision AI-driven solutions that contribute to revenue growth is a rare occurrence. This is precisely where AI Professionals like us come into play. In the forthcoming episodes, we‚Äôll delve into the reasons why organizations often lack in-house AI expertise.
Understanding and Crafting Solutions:
As AI Professionals, we dive deep into comprehending the intricacies of our client companies‚Äô businesses. This encompasses not only the enterprise itself but also the broader industry landscape, market trends, and competition. By gaining an intimate understanding of specific industry needs, anticipating future requirements, and strategizing for differentiation, we lay the foundation for effective solutions. This process involves meticulous planning, budgeting, and projecting potential gains. This skill, often referred to as ‚Äúconsulting,‚Äù is an essential facet of an AI Professional‚Äôs toolkit.
The Fusion of Technical and Domain Knowledge:
While graduating from prestigious institutions like The University of Tokyo or MIT is commendable, crafting exceptional AI solutions may have a very low chance of success without domain-specific knowledge. In essence, becoming an AI Professional necessitates a blend of technical prowess and profound domain expertise. If I were to quantify the necessary ratio, it would be something like 5:5 or 4:6, with the latter emphasizing domain knowledge.
To become an AI professional, one needs to possess 60% skillset and 40% technical knowledge.
So, how does one embark on the journey to become an AI Professional?
The Path to AI Expertise:
Beginning a career in AI is a transformative journey that requires both technical skills and specialized knowledge. While a background in mathematics and physics can be advantageous, it is by no means a prerequisite. Here are some steps to initiate your journey toward becoming an AI professional:
Step 1: Mastery of Programming Languages
Commence your journey by mastering programming languages, with Python being a primary focus. Explore various machine learning libraries. Online courses and tutorials offer valuable resources for skill acquisition.
Step 2: Identification of AI-Driven Solutions
Analyze problems within your immediate surroundings and contemplate how AI can address them. Apply the knowledge gained in Step 1 to devise and implement innovative solutions.
Step 3: Real-World Application and Internship
Consider interning with AI-related companies to tackle real-life challenges and gain hands-on experience. During interviews, articulate your achievements from Steps 1 and 2 to increase your chances of success.
I am genuinely excited about the future when I hear children say:
‚ÄúWhen I grow up, I want to develop AI solutions and contribute to making the world a better place!‚Äù
It‚Äôs important to inspire the next generation to pursue careers in AI and continue pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.
Stay tuned for the next part of our journey as we explore the world of AI and its potential for creating a better future.
(Note: The original text includes hints about the author‚Äôs project, which will be elaborated further in the upcoming posts.)

In the second episode of my journey, I found myself pondering a groundbreaking idea as a product manager. Back in 2017, the potential of AI had not yet permeated the mainstream, and only a few players were exploring its possibilities. It was during this time that I had a revelation that could revolutionize how businesses interacted with their customers.
The thought was simple yet powerful:
‚ÄúIf we can create promotions specialized for each user, can‚Äôt we improve conversion rates and increase sales?‚Äù
I saw the potential of AI in transforming the way businesses engaged with their customers, personalizing experiences, and driving success.
At the time, my company was substantial, boasting over 5,000 employees and offices across the world. Surprisingly, we didn‚Äôt have a dedicated AI team. As I delved deeper into the issue, I discovered that this was a widespread challenge faced by many companies. The lack of AI development systems hindered their ability to unlock the true potential of personalized experiences.
Driven by the belief that AI solutions could be the key to unlocking this potential, I made a life-changing decision:
‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs create a business related to AI.‚Äù
To kickstart this new venture, I recognized the importance of addressing three crucial steps:
Step 1: Clarify what challenges can be solved.
Step 2: Check if it can generate revenue and stand as a business.
Step 3: Establish superiority by differentiating from existing solutions.
At that time, AI solutions were mainly offered by software consulting firms, but I noticed a few key characteristics that set them apart. The timeline to release a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) typically took around a year, and the cost ranged from 20 million yen to 100 million yen. This high cost made it challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises or growing companies to adopt AI solutions.
Furthermore, these consulting firms primarily focused on larger enterprises, neglecting the needs of smaller companies and non-technology-focused businesses. The lack of a clear return on investment made investing in AI solutions a high-risk decision for many.
Realizing the potential to create AI solutions that catered to the needs of all businesses, from large corporations to small and medium-sized enterprises, I was inspired to establish ‚ÄúAI Solutions for Digital Products: Gigalogy AI Platform.‚Äù I envisioned a company that would bridge the gap and provide accessible, cost-effective, and efficient AI solutions to businesses of all sizes, enabling them to unlock the full potential of personalized experiences.
In the upcoming episodes, I‚Äôll share the challenges, triumphs, and pivotal moments that shaped the growth of ‚ÄúGigalogy AI Platform.‚Äù Join me as I continue on this exhilarating journey, determined to make a lasting impact on businesses and their customers through the power of AI.

Our CEO, Mosleh Uddin, just returned from the 7-day startup accelerator X-HUB TOKYO London program, in partnership with JETRO - Japan External Trade Organization and L Marks.

This program has provided invaluable support for Gigalogy's global expansion efforts, offering insights into the dynamic UK market. 
With London's thriving tech ecosystem and the UK's position as Europe's largest e-commerce market, the growth opportunities are immense.

Understanding the UK Market:

The UK stands as a beacon of innovation in e-commerce personalization, boasting a market size of ¬£160 billion, positioning itself as Europe's largest e-commerce market and the third-largest globally, following China and the US. 

London, in particular, serves as a nucleus for e-commerce companies, hosting 21 unicorns, including industry giants like FARFETCH, Depop, and ASOS.com. Its conducive business environment and robust connectivity fuel the growth of tech-savvy consumers, creating unparalleled opportunities for companies like Gigalogy.

Key Takeaways from London:

- In 2020, a staggering 87% of UK internet users engaged in online shopping, constituting 14.5% of global online retail sales.
- UK consumers exhibit advanced technological adoption, spending 82 billion hours on mobile shopping apps in 2020, marking a 30% increase from the previous year.
- With an annual expenditure of ¬£3,250 per shopper online, UK consumers outpace their global counterparts, underscoring the market's potential for growth and profitability.
- London's thriving tech ecosystem witnessed 75 unicorns raising a record $26 billion in funding in 2021, surpassing any other European capital.
- The city attracted $5 billion in venture capital investment in its e-commerce sector alone in 2021, positioning it as a formidable contender on the global stage.

Gigalogy's Next Chapter:

Fueled by these insights and connections, Gigalogy is gearing up for an exciting 2024:
- Forging Strategic Partnerships: We're actively seeking collaborations with key players in the UK to leverage their expertise and expand our reach.
- Building Investor Relations: We're committed to attracting investment that fuels our global growth ambitions.

In the first episode of my story, I want to take you back to the beginning, when my fascination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) first took root and led me on an incredible journey to Japan.
The origin story of Gigalogy begins with me, Mosleh Uddin, the founder and CEO of the company. I hail from Bangladesh and embarked on a life-changing journey to Japan in 2009, fueled by a scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan. In this episode, I‚Äôll share the reasons behind my decision to start Gigalogy after completing my studies at Osaka University and The University of Tokyo, along with my valuable experiences at companies like Rakuten.
As I reflect on my journey, I can‚Äôt help but feel immense gratitude for the opportunity to study in Japan. The country‚Äôs reputation for technological advancements and its vibrant AI research community were major attractions for me. I was captivated by the prospect of immersing myself in a culture that seamlessly blended tradition with cutting-edge innovation.
Throughout my academic journey, I dedicated myself to the field of AI, specializing in machine learning and AI algorithms. I devoured research papers, attended conferences, and engaged in thought-provoking discussions with fellow enthusiasts.
Upon my arrival in Japan, I was immediately struck by the harmonious blend of tradition and progress that permeated the country. The breathtaking landscapes, bustling cities, and the palpable energy of technological advancement invigorated my spirit. I knew I had made the right decision.
During my time in Japan, I seized every opportunity to connect with esteemed researchers, industry professionals, and like-minded AI enthusiasts. Their wisdom and guidance further fueled my passion and propelled me forward. I had the privilege of working with brilliant minds at renowned institutions and companies, including Rakuten, where I gained valuable experience and honed my skills.
As my knowledge and expertise in AI grew, so did my conviction to create something remarkable. In 2020, I founded Gigalogy, a pioneering company dedicated to providing cutting-edge AI solutions. It was the culmination of my dreams, the manifestation of my unwavering belief in the power of AI to revolutionize industries and improve lives.
With Gigalogy, We aim to bridge the gap between AI research and practical applications, empowering businesses to harness the full potential of AI in their operations. Our goal is to develop innovative solutions that would enhance efficiency, drive growth, and unlock new opportunities across various sectors.
In this first episode of my journey, I‚Äôve shared the story of how my quest for knowledge and experience brought me to Japan, ultimately leading to the creation of Gigalogy. Little did I know that this was just the beginning of an extraordinary adventure that would push the boundaries of AI and inspire countless innovations.
Join me in the upcoming episodes as I delve deeper into the fascinating world of AI, sharing the triumphs, the challenges, and the groundbreaking moments that continue to shape Gigalogy‚Äôs path and my personal evolution in this ever-evolving field.

GPT Feedback
After establishing your GPT project and engaging with your bot, you may want to provide response on the dialogue quality.
Providing Feedback via API
To facilitate this, the endpoint PUT /v1/gpt/conversations would be of use. This endpoint allows you to designate specific conversations through their IDs, assign either positive or negative feedback, and optionally include a message conveying your review details. Such feedback is instrumental for refining the model's training and future results optimization.
Sharing Feedback via the User Interface
Under your GPT project's insight tab, you can see the history of your conversations in the the "GPT-Flow History" table. From the "Training data" column, you can edit the query, response and provide feedback. You can also select here which data should be added for future training and under which dataset.

GPT 
Gigalogy,s GPT based solutions allows you to make your own GPT solutions, trained with your own data, customized according to your needs. Here are some basics to get you started. Find  related endpoints in our sandbox.
Documents
Documents are information that GPT will consider as a single piece of information, such as Address of Gigalogy, What is Gigalogy personalization, etc.
Datasets
A Dataset is a collection of documents in a single file. For instance, single dataset may contain documents with information such as Address of Gigalogy, What is Gigalogy personalization, What is Gigalogy's .
Profiles
With each request sent to GPT endpoints POST /v1/gpt/ask and POST /v1/gpt/ask/vision, we include a parameter called gpt_profile_id. This parameter's value points to a GPT profile. GPT profiles hold information that tells the GPT how to process the information provided (query) and how to respond. To see more about what is inside a profile, check out the parameters and the example request body of the endpoint POST /v1/gpt/profiles.
There are two types of profiles. One is for the /gpt/ask endpoint, which is a general profile for any model except gpt-4-vision-preview. The other is for the /gpt/ask/vision endpoint, for which we currently support only gpt-4-vision-preview as the model.

 for  involves preparing, uploading and training your data. Additionally, set up the required setting the parameters to suit your requirement.
Dataset
Upload Dataset
Use the endpoint POST /v1/gpt/datasets to upload a dataset that will be used to train your customized GPT bot. Currently, we accept CSV and JSON format. You will find the required parameters and description in the sandbox in the link above.
How to see uploaded datasets
Once the dataset is uploaded, you can use /v1/gpt/datasets to see all your datasets of your project. The response will give you below details along with the datasets ids. This dataset_id will be required to edit, delete, train your data.
  {
    "dataset_id": "a8bf8ddd-b5cb-4bea-a82b-4ac148f01c0a",
    "created_at": "2023-12-24T20:23:34.992063+09:00",
    "name": "NAME OF THE DATASET",
    "description": DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET,
    "idx_column_name": "idx",
    "image_url_column": "images"
  }
Delete dataset
Use the endpoint DELETE /v1/gpt/datasets/{dataset_id} to delete a dataset or particular documents from a dataset. You can find the expected request body, with required parameters and values in our sandbox here
Update Dataset
To be updated
Updating and deleting - Documents
To be updated
Training
Use endpoint POST /v1/gpt/dataset/train to train your uploaded dataset. This endpoint will take the dataset id and image type. It is good practice to train only what is necessary to optimize the usage of resources.
Profile
Setup profile
Use POST /v1/gpt/profiles to setup GPT profile. You can setup multiple profiles. However you will need to select one as the default profile in the next step.
Here are some detail about "intro", "System" and "Model" parameters.
Intro: This is detailed instruction for the bot on how to respond to a query. For example, if you are creating a customer support bot for an E-commerce site "AAA", this parameter could be: "Answer customer questions based on the catalog information and FAQ documents of our company. If a customer wants a product recommendation, ask up to three questions to understand their needs better, then make three recommendations and ask the customer if they like them or want different recommendations."
System: This tells the bot about the persona it is supposed to adopt. For example, if you are creating a customer support bot for an E-commerce site "AAA", selling cosmetics, this parameter could be: "You are customer support for AAA, an expert on skincare and cosmetic products who values customer needs and provides the right product recommendations."
Model: We support all GPT models of OpenAI, which you can select based on the needs and use cases. Please consider the purpose and the estimated token count when selecting the model, as this can significantly impact costs. You can learn more about OpenAI models from this page. This setting will impact the parameters search_max_token (tokens allocated for data sent to the model) and completion_token (tokens allocated for the reply). Note that intro, system, and query have token costs that are not included in the token size allocation. The selected model's CONTEXT WINDOW should cover the total token allocation. That is CONTEXT WINDOW ‚â• search_max_token + completion_token + intro + system + query.
You can use the use the endpoints in our sandbox under " Profiles" to Check the profiles and update or delete them.
Default profile setup
Once you have setup the profile(s), decide one of the profiles that should be default and use our endpoint POST /v1/gpt/settings to set your default profile.
with this, your GPT setup is completed.

Title: Environment setup - Gigalogy Tutorial

Content:

To prepare GAIP for your site, there are 2 main steps
Mapping creation
Index creation
Info
These steps can also be done from our platform (GAIP). Refer here for detail.
For this, we will use API endpoints of GAIP listed in our Sandbox
You can also access our sandbox from the project setting page.
Mapping creation
The personalization engine relies on specific default keys to operate effectively. To integrate your item catalogue with our solution, it's essential to align your website's data source keys (such as item name, item description, tags, ingredients, category, etc.) with keys of personalization engine via mapping them. Our personalizer then can understand your data. This is the core part of the personalization system so the schema should be followed properly to successfully map your data.
Item Catalogue Mapping
To create mapping, use endpoints listed under Catalog Mapping in the sandbox.
GET /v1/mappers to get an existing Mapper.
PUT /v1/mappers to update an existing Mapper.
POST /v1/mappers to create a new mapper.
For set up your project mapping we will use POST /v1/mappers. You can find keys, value types, and description with an example request body in the sandbox You can simply replace the values in the example with your item catalogue keys and hit Execute to finish the mapping of your product catalogue Keys with GAIP keys.
After execution, confirm the server response is success.
Example of this item mapper creation
Here, we will use doozie shop as an example E-commerce site.
For an example item from the shop, this is how the data is structured.
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "item_id": "12345",
      "title": "Eco-Friendly Water Bottle",
      "description": "A durable, BPA-free water bottle designed for everyday use. Made from eco-friendly materials, it keeps your drink cold for up to 24 hours. Perfect for staying hydrated on the go.",
      "headline": "Stay Hydrated with Our Eco-Friendly Water Bottle",

      ],
      "tag_ids": [
        1000903,
        1008869,
        1039853,

      ],
      "tags": [],
      "shipping_overseas": "",
      "condition": 1,
      "genre_name": null,
      "parent_genre_categories": null,

      "sale_start_time": "",
      "sale_end_time": "",
      "platform": "rakuten"
    }
  ]
}
This shows the keys that doozie shop has for its products. Now we can create a mapping with GAIP keys, and use the POST /v1/mapper endpoint of GAIP. In this endpoint, we will pass the keys of above data source.
Here is an example of a mapper that we built for doozie shop, based on the keys above:
{
  "key_map": {
    "item_id": "item_id",
    "title": "title",
    "second_title": "headline",
    "third_title": "shop_name",
    "fourth_title": "genre_name",
    "availability": "availability",
    "description": "description",
    "image_url": "image_urls",
    "image_url_type": "LIST_STR",
    "item_url": "item_url",
    "price": "price",
    "categories": [
      {
        "name": "genre_id",
        "separator": ""
      }
    ],
    "custom":[],
    "flag": [
      "condition"
    ]
  }
}
Sample Code
You can find sample code for this implementation here
Once the mapper is created, you can use GET /v1/mappers endpoint to see the mapping. You can update any of mapped keys with PUT /v1/mapper endpoint and check the mapper you build from GET /v1/mapper endpoint.
User Behavior mapping
Similar to the item mapping key, there are some default keys for user behavior data.
Note
This step is required If you want to save historical user behavior data through CSV files. If you use our data collection endpoints to collect data from now on, this is not required.
You can find the Endpoints for user mapping under "Historical User Data Collection" section in the Sandbox
To implement this, please follow similar steps as above.
However, in this case please note that there are four sets of endpoints for Browsing history, purchase history, rating history, user detail. You have to create mapper for each if you want to import the data.
Index creation
In this step, you need to create indices. We need multiple indices to run recommender solution successfully. These indices will create the necessary schemas to hold your data.
There are 3 endpoints here
POST /v1/index/create --> Create indices to hold your data
DELETE /v1/index/delete --> Delete indices
POST /v1/reindex --> Creates index with new mappings and settings and create alias for new index
Create Index
Request endpoint
POST /v1/index/create
Simply use your project key and API and click execute to create the indices for your project. Note that this will throw an error if the mapping in the previous step is not done correctly.
After the successful execution all the necessary index will be created and item index will be created in the background. You can check the status of item index creation with a task id from GET /v1/tasks/{task_id} API at the bottom of the page.
Please confirm the task was success.
Delete Index
You can delete an existing index with this endpoint.
Request endpoint
DELETE /v1/index/delete
Available values are items, image_features, browse, purchase, ratings, search, stats, settings, user, tasks, logs.
If you Delete any index, please ensure to create the index again, unless you will get error when trying to input data/item catalogue or run training.
Reindex
In Elastic search, reindexing is the process of copying data from one index to another, either within the same cluster or to a different cluster. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as:
Updating the mapping of an index: If you need to make changes to the mapping of an index, you can create a new index with the updated mapping and then reindex the data from the old index to the new one.
Moving data from one index to another: If you need to move data from one index to another, you can reindex the data from the source index to the destination index.
Updating the data with new data: If you have updated data that you want to add to an index, you can reindex the data with the updated data.
Changing the shard count of an index: If you need to change the number of shards that an index is using, you can reindex the data to a new index with the desired number of shards.
We can use Reindex API to copy data from index to another index.
Request Endpoint:
POST /v1/reindex
Here is an example how to pass mappings and settings in request body:

      }
    }
  }
}
Available values are items, image_features, browse, purchase, ratings, search, stats, settings, user, tasks, logs. When you define the mappings object, you should use the same keys as in the item mapper that you have built with POST /v1/mapper API.
You might not need analyzers or tokenizers for all indices. You can keep the settings field empty if it is not required. Here is an example,
{
  "index_type": "search",
  "mappings": {
    "settings": {},
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "date": {
          "type": "date"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Title: Training your data - Gigalogy Tutorial

Content:

After you have integrated and saved your data in the GAIP database, you can train and generate intelligence from your data. You need to train several models to get your desired output. In GAIP, there are three different models that have been designed to serve different purposes.
All models are trained at regular intervals. You can also train the models manually using the following endpoints.
Info
It is recommended to run all the trainings once manually after importing the item catalog/data into GAIP. After that you can check the result immediately
Info
These steps can also be done from our platform (GAIP). Refer here for detail.
Item Training
Item model takes your items from the database and generates intelligence from it so that our solution could recommend items from user behavior and filter out items with personalized search results.
Request endpoint for training item model:
GET /v1/item/train 
Image Training
Image model takes image url from item database and generates feature vectors. Feature vectors leads to calculate the similarity score and predict similar image.
Request endpoint for training image model:
GET /v1/image/train 
Rank Training
Rank model considers user behavior, item relations from item data to predict most trending items.
Note
You will need user data to train the rank model. Follow user behavior section to save user data.
Request endpoint for training rank model:
GET /v1/rank/train 
While hitting the training endpoints, you will get a task id in response. You can check the training status of the model using that task id from GET v1/tasks/{task_id} endpoint.
It is recommended to always check and confirm with the Task endpoints to confirm the status of the training. When using it for the first time, it might take some time to complete.
You could also check the status of any training model with task type from GET/v1/tasks endpoint. By default, you will get the latest 100 tasks with their details.
You can train each model once in 24 hours time frame.

 engine
Our endpoint /v1/items/search, generates personalized search results tailored for each user in your application.
It considers user behavior, current trends, and more and returns a customized search result for each individual.
This endpoint takes several parameters to generate customized search results.
To implement this solution, please use the endpoint /v1/items/search. The required parameters and an example request body can be found in our sandbox here.
You can find sample code for this implementation here.
Please note
category : User can search the items using category field using the value that you have mapped in the environment setup (mapper creation) with the "category" key.
flag : If you have any boolean values in your dataset and set as flag in mapper settings you can pass those values to filter the items using flag field.
sort : In sort field you have to pass columns that doesn't contain text field. You couldn't pass title, second_title, third_title, fourth_title, description as the column name.

Title: Project setup - Gigalogy Tutorial

Content:

Once the project is created, now it is time to setup the project.
In the coming sections, we will guide you through various steps such as "data mapping" and "creating indexes" (found under the Environment Setup section), "integrating data" (explained in the Integration of Catalogue Information and User Behavior Data section), and "training your data" (in the Training Your Data section). These sections will cover you how to perform these actions by directly using our endpoints from the sandbox.
In this section, we will show you how to complete all these steps directly through our platform UI.
 from UI
Upload data
After creating project, go inside the project. At the top, there will be four tabs DETAILS, SETTINGS, INSIGHTS, SETUP. Click and go to the SETUP. Here you will find a box to upload your data file. Currently we accept CSV files only. Select your CSV file and click upload.
Mapping your data
In the next page, you will see a suggested mapping done for your data. Gigalogy personalization engine relies on specific default keys to operate. To integrate your item catalogue with our solution, it's essential to map you data source keys (such as item name, item description, tags, ingredients, category, etc.) with keys of Gigalogy personalization engine. Our personalizer then can understand your data.
You can update the suggested mapping as you find necessary. This can also be modified later. When satisfied, click continue to proceed to the next step
Rank Setting
In the Rank settings step, you can modify and set the settings for the rank training, which will impact the "trending items" recommendation. If you are not sure about this, we highly recommend to keep it as it is (Default settings). Click continue to proceed to the next step.
Setup completion
In the next page you will see the status of the project setup. If there is any issue, it should give you the reason and you will be asked to restart the process. Please contact us if you fail to resolve the issue at support@gigalogy.com.
If all above steps are completed successfully, your project setup is done.
Next go to the SETTINGS tab, and you will find the section "Train data". Hit the "Train" button for each (Item, image, rank) to train your data. This is recommended to do once when you first setup your project. After this, it will run automatically every 3 hours (Default setting is 3 hours, can be changed based on requirement).
Below you will find the training history with their status. You can update the rank settings and mapper.
If you want to re-upload your data, go to the DATASET tab again to re-upload. This will not replace your old data, only add new data.

Title: Personalized Feed - Gigalogy Tutorial

Content:

These solutions can be used to personalize the user feed when they log into your website, open the homepage, or search for products, among other actions.
There are two endpoints here that you can use at different sections of the page
1. users/recommend
POST /v1/users/recommend can be used to personalize the user feed such as the home page or some other general pages.
v1/users/recommend endpoint understands user behavior such as browse history, purchase history, favorites/wishlist, time spent in your application and returns the most suitable items for them as a response.
The details of required parameters and a sample request body for this can be found here.
You can find sample code for implementation here.
2. users/search/recommend
This endpoint analyzes user search history and, based on that, returns recommended items to the user. It can be integrated into the user feed, the top page, personalized suggestions, or as a widget, among other applications.
Additionally, the response from this endpoint can be utilized to send users emails about products recommended based on their search history.
Request path:
POST /v1/users/search/recommend
To implement this solution, you can find the description of the required parameters and an example request body here. You can find sample codes for implementation here.

Title: Integration of Catalogue information and user behavior data - Gigalogy Tutorial

Content:

This tutorial will cover how to integrate your catalogue information into GAIP and how to set up user behavior tracking and integrate with GAIP.
Catalogue information integration.
Prerequisite: Mapping creation and the index creation is done.
Info
This step can also be done from our platform (GAIP). Refer here for detail.
There are two ways to import your catalogue information into GAIP.
Upload you catalogue information as a CSV or JSON file using endpoint POST /v1/item/save.
Fetch data from your API (or any external API) using endpoint POST /v1/item/save/remote.
Uploading data using a file
For uploading the data using a CSV file or JSON file, please use the POST /v1/item/save endpoint. Simply upload the file and confirm the server response is success. Confirm the task was successful using the GET/v1/tasks/{task_id} endpoint.
Info
This will throw an error and task will fail, if the keys during the Mapping creation step does not match with the keys in the file, OR if the indices were not created succesfully.
Fetch item from external API
To fetch data from external API, use the POST /v1/item/save/remote endpoint. The key and value types and an example request body for the endpoint can be found here in our sandbox.
After hitting either of the endpoint above to import your data into GAIP, you will get a task ID in the response. Use this task ID and hit the /v1/tasks/{task_id} endpoint to confirm the operation was successful. In case it fails, you can also find the details there. For API documentation, please refer <>
Search Items in GAIP after import
You can search items by passing list of item ids fromPOST /v1/items/search endpoint. This endpoint will return searched items with item details.
It is recommended to use this endpoint to confirm that the item catalogue is successfully imported into your project.
User behavior data collection integration
GAIP can collect different user behavior related information to optimize the recommendation for the user. Types of data collected are listed below with their endpoints.
Data type Endpoint
Product browsing: When user browse products. /v1/items/browse or /v1/items/browse/client
Product Purchase: When user purchase a product with its quantity. /v1/items/purchase or /v1/items/purchase/client
Rating: When a user rates a product. /v1/items/rating or /v1/items/rating/client
User: User information such as age, gender and other customized attributes depending on your website. /v1/users or /v1/users/client
You will find these endpoints listed in our Sandbox under section "User Data Collection". Please check the required parameters, value types and example request bodies for all the endpoints there.
There are 3 ways to integrate user behavior data collection with GAIP
Google Tag Manager
Server to server integration
Client to server integration
You can also bulk upload user behavior data from the past. For that, please refer to Import user behavior data section.
Comparison of each approach.
Approach GTM Server to Server Client to Server
Description Use Google Tag Manager (GTM) to collect data (User behavior) from your website and send it to GAIP via endpoint. The data is captured in the backend server of your application and then sent to GAIP via endpoint. The data is directly sent from your front end (Client side) to GAIP via endpoint.
Pros Easy to implement, Minimum coding required, Flexible configuration More secure, Data integrity, Controlled environment Real-time data, Less server dependency
Cons Limited customization, need to have basic knowledge about GTM, Dependency on third-party service, Might not work for certain browsers and plugins like AdBlockers More complex to set up, potential latency, maintenance required Less secure, Potential for inconsistent data, dependency on client-side behavior
Below we will show the implementation of each approach.
BE ADVISED: The following is a general guideline, and it may vary across different websites, contingent upon the specific implementation of your website.
Google Tag manager
Prerequisite: Your website must have GTM setup. If you do not have GTM setup, you can easily do the setup by following the guidelines here.
If you are not familiar with basic GTM concepts, such as Tags, Triggers and Variables, please familiarize yourself first with these concepts before proceeding with this approach. You can find more resources related to this here.
Generating user ID
In our sandbox, Notice that in the user data collection endpoints, every endpoint has a parameter called user_id, and member_id. These are vital to identify each user so that you can personalize their experience. user_id is generated by GAIP for each user of your site. The endpoint to generate and user_id is GET /v1/users/generate/id. You can generate the user_id using GTM using below code. This code can be used with every Tag, which checks if there is a user_id and creates one if there is none.
// Function to get or generate 'gaip_user_id' using a function expression
var getGaipUser = function() {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    if (gaipUser !== null) {
      resolve(gaipUser);
    } else {
      var idHeaders = new Headers();
      idHeaders.append("project-key", "{{ YOUR_PROJECT_KEY_HERE }}");
      idHeaders.append("api-key", "{{ YOUR_API_KEY_HERE }}");
      fetch("https://api.recommender.gigalogy.com/v1/users/generate/id", { headers: idHeaders })
      .then(function(response) {
        return response.json();
      })
      .then(function(data) {
        localStorage.setItem('gaip_user_id', data.detail.response);
        resolve(data.detail.response);
      })
      .catch(reject);
    }
  });
};
member_id can be set by you depending on how your site identifies unique users such as user ID, phone number, email address etc.
Collecting and sending user browsing data
Set up a variable to capture the product name/title/ID, when the user goes a product details page or clicks on a product to enlarge it or open a pop-up etc.
Set up a trigger so that the tag would fire when the user goes browses an item (Go to product detail page or quick view options etc.).
Create a custom HTML Tag with the above trigger and variable and put the below code in the tag.
Collecting and sending user purchase data
Set up a variable to capture the all the purchase detail, when the user makes a purchase. This could be from the purchase confirmation page etc.
Set up a trigger so that the tag would fire when the user make the purchase.
Create a custom HTML Tag with the above trigger to send the information to endpoint POST /v1/purchase or POST /v1/purchase/client
Collecting and sending user rating data
Setup variables to capture the product name/title/ID and the rating, when the user rates an item positively or negatively. We can also consider an item is positively rated when user adds the item to wishlist.
Set up a trigger for the tag to fire when the user rates a product.
Create a custom HTML Tag with the above trigger and variables to send the information to the endpoint POST /v1/rating or POST /v1/rating/client
Collecting and sending user data
Setup variable to capture the user information.
For this, the trigger could be setup up when the user logs or update their information.
Create a custom HTML Tag with the above trigger and variables to send the information to the endpoint POST /v1/user or POST /v1/user/client
Server to server integration
For server to server integration, you will need to generate Project key and API as mentioned in the credentials section.
User information
The below request path, takes user information, such as name, age, gender, address and saves them in the gaip database.
POST /v1/user
Here is an example request body
{
  "user_id": "a0cc6beb-2909-459b-be55-62196af78ce4",
  "member_id": "df3456tg-2909-459b-be55-62196afedf85",
  "user_info": {
    "address": "string",
    "gender": "integer --> 1 for male or 2 for female or 3 for others",
    "age": 25,
    "user_type": [
      {
        "key_name1": "value1_value2",
        "separator": "_"
      },
      {
        "key_name2": "value3"
      }
    ]
  }
}
You can find the sample code for implementation here
Product browse
You can use the below endpoint to capture user browsing information and save them in GAIP database
POST /v1/items/browse
It takes user_id and item_id as required parameters.
Here is an example value of the request body
  {
    "user_id": "a0cc6beb-2909-459b-be55-62196af78ce4",
    "member_id": "df3456tg-2909-459b-be55-62196afedf85",
    "item_id": "1000764491"
  }
You can find sample code here
Product purchase
You can use the below endpoint to capture user's product purchase information and save them in GAIP database
POST /v1/purchase
It takes user_id, item_list which includes item_id, price, quantity for a specific item as required parameters.
Here is an example request body
  {
    "user_id": "a0cc6beb-2909-459b-be55-62196af78ce4",
    "member_id": "df3456tg-2909-459b-be55-62196afedf85",
    "item_list": [
      {
        "item_id": "1000757666",
        "price": 5000,
        "quantity": 1
      },
      {
        "item_id": "1000764491",
        "price": 400,
        "quantity": 7
      }
    ]
  }
You a find sample code for this implementation here
Product rating
You can use the below endpoint to capture user's product rating information and save them in GAIP database
POST /v1/rating
It takes user_id, item_id, and rating for the specific item as required parameters.
Here is a sample request body
{
  "user_id": "a0cc6beb-2909-459b-be55-62196af78ce4",
  "member_id": "df3456tg-2909-459b-be55-62196afedf85",
  "item_id": "1000764491",
  "rating": "1"
}
You can find the sample code for this implementation here
If you want to save your data with bulk upload you can use above-mentioned endpoint.
Client to server integration
For client to server integration, you will need to generate client key as described in the  sections. Once the client key is ready, you can directly send the request from your client side to GAIP, using the client key provided.
Note that while generating client key, you can add whitelisted domains, which whitelists the request origin. This is recommended to enhance security.
The rest of the implementation method is same as server to server integration.
Import user behavior data
Similar to data integration, all 4 kinds of user information (browse, purchase, rating, user) can be bulk uploaded. This could be useful if you already have this information from the past and want to import it into GAIP.
To import user behavior and user information in bulk, first you need to create mapper to match the keys with GAIP.
To create the mapper, the endpoints with the example request bodies can be found here in the gigalogy recommender page. You can also find the sample codes for mapper creation here in the API documentation page
Next we will use the below 4 endpoints to upload each category of data in bulk
Request path for product browsing history: POST /v1/items/browse/save
Request path for purchase history: POST /v1/items/purchase/save
Request path for rating history: POST /v1/items/rating/save
Request path to upload user information in bulk: POST /v1/users/save
You can find these endpoints with the example request bodies here. The sample code can be found here in the API documentation page

Title: Questionnaire - Gigalogy Tutorial

Content:

Our questionnaire software is specifically tailored to provide recommendations for novice and experienced users. Here is how it works:
 Design: We meticulously design the questionnaire to encapsulate all necessary questions and decisions.
 Registration: The questionnaire is seamlessly integrated into the project, enabling easy access and interaction.
User Response Collection: User responses are gathered through an interactive, user-friendly, UI-based questionnaire embedded in the website.
Response Processing: These responses are then processed by the GAIP system.
Product Recommendation: Finally, personalized product recommendations are suggested based on the processed responses.
Furthermore, the registration of the questionnaire into the project constitutes two crucial phases:
Registration of : Where the questionnaire is incorporated into the project.
Registration of  Mapper: Which equips the AI system with the knowledge to accurately interpret decisions based on the users' responses to the questions.
Registration of 
To manage the questionnaire, a series of RESTful API endpoints are provided which can be explored in our sandbox.
Creating a new questionnaire: Make a POST request to /v1/questionnaires to create a new questionnaire. The sandbox hosts detailed explanations and sample request bodies. The questionnaire can be divided into different sections, with at least one required.
Listing all questionnaires: Sending a GET request to /v1/questionnaires/list lists all the questionnaire's ID and names. A project can host multiple questionnaires that are differentiated through these IDs.
Viewing a questionnaire: Make a GET request to /v1/questionnaires/{questionnaire_id} to retrieve a specific questionnaire's details, including sections and questions.
Updating and deleting questionnaire: Use the PUT /v1/questionnaires/{questionnaire_id} and DELETE /v1/questionnaires/{questionnaire_id} endpoints to update or remove a questionnaire respectively.
Registration of  Mapper
A questionnaire mapper is essential to instruct the system on making decisions based on user responses. Corresponding endpoints for creating, viewing, and editing a mapper are found at /v1/questionnaires/{questionnaire_id}/mapper.
To create a mapper, use POST /v1/questionnaires/{questionnaire_id}/mapper.
The mapper consists of five main components:
Questions: This section maps the decisions for all questionnaire questions.
Exclusivity: Handles duplicate removal and exclusivity requirements.
Prompt Generation: This section produces prompts that are used by the AI to generate recommendations.
Prompt Order: Sets the sequence in which prompts appear.
GPT settings: Provides settings and parameters to the GPT module for context understanding.
Each section will be explained in detail as we progress further.
Questions
Inside a question object we add mapper for different possible values.
A questionnaire can have three types of questions 1. Radio button: User can select a single answer, 2. Checkbox: User can select multiple answers, 3. Free text: User can enter string.
To add mapper for a single value, use the value key as the key for related decision objects. This approach allows you to define how the system should handle or process that value.
Example
{
  "skincare_history": {
    "q2": {
      "mapper": {
        "a": {
          "exclude": ["Retinol",  "Retinol based products"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
In the above example, the key a represents answer selected by user. The object associated with a specifies decisions related to it‚Äîin this case, an exclude list. This list contains the values Retinol and Retinol based products, defined by the creator of the mapper. How this Exclude list is used is covered in a latter section below.
To add mapper for a combination of value (Answers with multiple selection), - Use | sign as or to combine more than one values for a decision in mapper. - Use & sign as and to combine more than one values for a decision in mapper. Example
{
  "a|b|c": {
    "exclude": ["Retinol",  "Retinol palmitate"]
  }
}
To add mapper for free-text value, use any key to add the decision rule. This can be useful for taking age, allergy information etc. Example
{
  "any": {
    "age": ""
  }
}
When a decision need to be taken if a set of value is not selected we should use negative selection.
An example scenario.
What of the following skincare you follow every day?
a. Cleanser b. Moisturizer c. Spf d. Serum e. Toner f. Night cream g. Eye cream
Decision: if cleanser, moisturizer and spf is chosen, AI will consider all products
If one of the basic step(cleanser, moisturizer, spf) is not chosen, Ai will exclude Retinol, Retinol palmitate, tranexamic acid, vitamin C, vitamin C derivative , arbutin
Here we need to take a decision if cleanser, moisturizer, spf is not selected, this is a candidate for negative selection.
Rules: Use ~ as key to add negative selection decisions in a question mapper. Use value serial as usual inside the negative selection object to add decision if a value is not selected, e.g. "a": "decision" Example
{
  "q1": {
    "mapper" : {
      "a": {
        "tags": ["acne", "anti-aging"]
      },
      "~": {
        "a|b|c": {
          "exclude": ["Retinol",  "Retinol palmitate",  "tranexamic acid",  "vitamin c",  "vitamin c derivative" , "arbutin"]
        },
        "d": {
          "tags": ["Retinol"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Exclusivity
The integration of exclusivity in the mapper is crucial for eliminating duplicates and addressing exclusivity prerequisites.
To incorporate exclusivity, you utilize the exclusive key to append an object in the following format:
"prompt_key-1" :  "prompt_key-2"
Doing so ensures that any value present in both prompt_key-1 and prompt_key-2, within the final prompt, will be extracted exclusively from prompt_key-2.
For instance:
{
  "exclusive": {
    "exclude": "includes",
    "exclude_tag": "include_tag"
  }
}
Prompt
Each prompt section is a decision point. A prompt section has two constituting parts, the sentence and the variable. Let's say we have a decision point to exclude products that has certain tags. we can add a prompt section named exclude_tags as follows
{
  "prompt_sections": {
    "exclude_tags": "Exclude any products that has following tags {exclude_tags}."
  }
}
And We need to add the exclude_tags in mapper wherever this decision point need to be mapped. An example mapper, like we have discussed above, would be
{
  "q1": {
    "mapper": {
      "a": {
        "exclude_tags": ["retinol", "retinol based products"]
      }
    }
  }
}
An example prompt section for a cosmetics company could be.
{
  "prompt_sections": {
    "age": "I am {age} years old.",
    "gender": "I am a {gender}.",
    "skin_type": "My skin type is {skin_type}.",
    "include_tag": "Show products that contain the tag: {include_tag}",
    "exclude_tag": "Exclude products that do contain the tag: {exclude_tag}"
  }
}
Prompt Order
This section is to decide the order of the prompts in the prompt section above. This section must contain all the prompts from the above section. This is the order by which the prompts will be sent to GPT model. Note: This order effects the quality of the response. User should try different orders to find the best result.
An example prompt order from the prompt_sections sample above sample could be:
{
  "prompt_order": [
    "age",
    "gender",
    "skin_type",
    "include_tag",
    "exclude_tag"
  ]
}
GPT Settings
This section is required for the context and various parameter setting for GPT. The prompt generated til this point above, goes to our GPT model, which is familiar with the item catalogue. This GPT model, in turn generates this recommendation for the user. Below is an example.
{
    "gpt_settings": {
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
    "search_max_token": 2500,
    "intro": "Using given context make recommendation. make recommendation of top {{ recommend_count }} products in json format and your response should denote the json part with three tick notations(```). Use `we` as your pronoun. json object should have following format. {'comment': 'make an overall comment about your recommendations', 'advice':'...', 'recommendations': [{'id':'...', 'comment': 'why you chose this product'},{'id':'...', 'comment': 'why you chose this product'}]}. if the query includes `specialist_pretext` then include that suggestion in your 'advice'",
    "system": "You are an expert on ...",
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 1,
    "frequency_penalty": 0,
    "presence_penalty": 0,
    "stop": [
      "AI:",
      "Human:"
    ],
    "recommend_count": 3,
    "result_includes": [
      "key_name_1",
      "key_name_2"
    ],
    "top_k": 20,
    "is_keyword_enabled": true
  }
}
Integration of  Recommendation
The questionnaire recommendation function processes user responses, identifies the corresponding questionnaire and decision points, and generates personalized recommendations. The endpoint POST /v1/questionnaire/recommend is designed for this purpose.
Detailed examples, required parameters, and explanations can be found in our sandbox.
This endpoint requires questionnaire_id as input. This identifier helps determine which questionnaire and mapping to consult, and which user response to consider, leading to the generation of personalized results.
You will notice the recommend_count parameter also exist in the mapper. If it is set, the value of this parameter takes priority over recommend_count variable in questionnaire mapper.
The response format of this endpoint can be customized using the previously mentioned GPT settings.
Reviewing  Recommendation Logs
By utilizing the endpoint GET /v1/questionnaires/{questionnaire_id}/logs, you're able to access the log of requests dispatched to the v1/questionnaire/recommend endpoint, along with the corresponding generated responses.

GPT Integration
After preparing, uploading and training your data, now you are ready to interact with your bot, by asking it question with texts and images via our endpoints.
Asking question to the bot
To send a text only question/query to GPT, use the endpoint POST /v1/gpt/ask. Find details of the required parameters with explanation and an example request body in our sandbox under ""
In the response, you will get the response to the query, along with some other information related, such as the conversation_id, tokens, etc.
For query with image, use the endpoint POST /v1/gpt/ask/vision. There is one additional parameter here, to add the image file. This endpoint will take both the image and the query and respond based on both input. Here you can only use gpt-4-vision-preview model.
Note that if you do not pass any gpt_profile_id, it will use the default profile that was set during the setup.
Checking conversation history
There are two ways to check conversation history 1. Using API endpoint 2. From the GAIP UI.
Using endpoint
Using our endpoint GET /v1/gpt/conversations, you can check conversation history of your project, for a specific date range. By default, (if no time period is specified), this endpoint will give the conversation history for last 7 days. If you want to see the response detail of any particular conversation, you can use your endpoint GET /v1/gpt/conversations/{conversation_id}. This endpoint will take the conversation ID and will give the detail of that particular conversation.
From the GAIP UI
In our platform, navigate to your project's insight page. Here you will find "GPT-Flow History" table. This will show all the conversation during the time range selected above. You can filter this table with user id, query, feedback. You can also see the details of each conversation by clicking on the details icon at the right. To download the history table, use the download button at the top right of the table. This will download the table as CSV. Note that the downloaded file will only contain the information as it is on the table, with the date and other filters applied.

Mapper
Mapper is the system to map recommender key to data source key. Therefore, solution can understand data from any data source generate intelligence from them.
Reindex
Reindexing is a process to copy documents from one index to another, optionally filtering the source documents by a query, fetching the documents from a remote cluster. You will about to change the settings and mappings of a destination index with reindex.
Index Settings
Index settings are one of the index modules created per index and control all aspects of the index.
Index Mappings
Index mapping is the process of defining how a document and the fields it contained are sorted and indexed.

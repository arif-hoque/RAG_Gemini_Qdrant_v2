📣 Exciting research update! 🌐📚

Announcing a new blog post that delves into the world of AI and its impact on society. We evaluate and enhance the value judgments made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in our study, "Evaluating and Improving Value Judgments in AI: A Scenario-Based Study on Large Language Models' Depiction of Social Conventions." 

As AI technologies continue to advance, it becomes crucial to ensure that the output they produce aligns with human needs. In this research, we explore how contemporary AI services meet user expectations and delve into LLMs' depiction of social conventions. 

Findings from our query experiment, which compared LLMs' value judgments with public data, provide interesting insights. We propose a model of decision-making in value-conflicting scenarios, which may shape future machine value judgments. Our approach advocates for using AI as a tool to explore different perspectives and remote worlds.

Join us on this exciting journey towards safe and accurate value judgments in AI. Read the full blog post here: https://bit.ly/3R49yej 📖💡

Let's empower ourselves with a critical perspective on AI and its role in shaping our environment. We hope this study inspires anyone, regardless of their capacity, to effectively receive value judgment-based outputs. #AIresearch #ValueJudgments #LLMs

🧠 Introducing an Insightful New Paper on the Future of AI! 🚀 by two folks I respect a lot Gary Marcus and Douglas Lenat | They understand the landscape, the history of how we got here, are realists and optimists at the same time. 

Generative AI, including large language models (LLMs), is the current trend in AI. And it's not perfect – they're often unpredictable, uninterpretable, and lack in reasoning abilities.

This groundbreaking paper lays out 16 key desires for future AI, and an alternative approach that could remedy these shortcomings:

✅ Using explicit knowledge and rules
✅ Enabling an inference engine for logical deductions
✅ Producing trustworthy and interpretable results

However, there's a challenge:  How to make this engine fast without losing expressive logic? 🤔 Enter the CYC project! It has developed ways to overcome this tradeoff, enabling real-time reasoning in higher-order logic.

The paper advocates for a hybridized approach, combining the strengths of LLMs and more formal methodologies. This new direction could be a game-changer in our journey towards more reliable and robust AI systems.

Paper: https://lnkd.in/gw-J_c8E 

💼 Explore the paper to learn more about this path to realizing the dream of trustworthy general AI!

Ramsay Brown my take 

The article on the ISDO Cycle is an exceptional contribution to the discourse surrounding the rapid advancements in AI tech, particularly focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers a comprehensive framework, aptly named ISDO (Innovate, Scale, Democratize, Optimize), which neatly encapsulates the complex, dynamic, and interrelated mechanisms driving the rapid evolution of LLMs
One of the strengths of this article lies in the depth of its analysis and the multidisciplinary insights it incorporates. The Innovate phase, for instance doesn't just talk about machine learning as an isolated field but borrows from neuroscience and cognitive sciences to provide a well-rounded perspective. This multidisciplinary approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the tech progress we are witnessing
This doesn't shy away from discussing the real-time changes affecting the ISDO Cycle. The Scale phase, which is often considered to be a straight process of adding more computational power, is shown to have its caveats. Recent developments indicate that the old adage "Scale is all you need" is evolving. This temporal aspect makes the article not just a snapshot but more of a dynamic update on the state of LLMs
The discussion around the Democratize phase is particularly relevant. The article delves into how open-source contributions and dissemination via platforms like arXiv, Github, and Twitter are essentially crowd-sourcing the cycle's efficiency. This is not just an observation but an acknowledgment of a decentralized network's power, which broadens the base of contributors and quickens the pace of innovation
The Optimize phase, with its focus on parameter quantization and pruning, speaks volumes about the technological feasibility of these advanced models. It's not just a theoretical debate; the article connects the dots between the lab and real-world applications, explaining how these optimized models can be deployed in edge devices and how they are becoming more environmentally friendly
This also acknowledges the diverse group of stakeholders, from Frontier Model labs like Google and OpenAI to venture capital firms like A16Z. It showcases the ecosystem as a collaborative and symbiotic space, rather than a competitive arena, which is refreshing and closer to the reality of scientific and technological advancements
The blog does not ignore the elephant in the room—governance. By pointing out the challenges in AI governance, it makes a compelling case for why understanding the ISDO Cycle is crucial not just for technologists but also for policymakers
The blog serves as both a lens to view the current landscape and a compass to navigate the future of LLMs. It combines rigorous analysis with a wide-ranging scope, making it an indispensable read for anyone interested in the future of AI and machine learning. It doesn't just tell us where we are; it gives us a comprehensive toolset to understand why we are here and where we are headed

🏎 It's not just you: yes, everything in AI is speeding up. Here's why.
From the Mission Control blog today: the ISDO Cycle (3 min read). 🏎

The ISDO Cycle is a conceptual framework that describes how and why AI capabilities improvement and proliferation - especially Large Language Models (LLMs) - appear to be accelerating.

ISDO is a four-stroke process: Innovate, Scale, Democratize, and Optimize. It encapsulates the self-reinforcing cycle driving the current Cambrian explosion in AI technology - especially incorporating the open source community.

We're proud to bring you the first of our Mission Briefing series to help you navigate an accelerating AI landscape.

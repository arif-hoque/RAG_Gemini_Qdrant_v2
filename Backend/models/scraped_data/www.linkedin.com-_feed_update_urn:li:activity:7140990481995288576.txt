Just wrapped up an insightful event with our partner Cross Compass, Ltd., exploring the frontiers of "Generative AI for the Manufacturing Industry." 
Here's a glimpse into the highlights and key takeaways of yesterday's talküí°

- Navigating the GPT Bot Development Landscape: We have explored the difficulties in developing GPT bots, focusing on fine-tuning and data preprocessing, and how Gigalogy's expertise provides invaluable support in these areas. It was enlightening to see the practical solutions that Gigalogy offers for these complex processes.

- 's Dual Processing Capability: attendees discovered the advanced functionality of Gigalogy's , which uniquely processes both image and text prompts concurrently. 
This dual capability allows  to understand and extract information from images while responding to text prompts, enhancing the depth and accuracy of its intelligence gathering and user interactions.

- Application in the Manufacturing Industry: We explored how this cutting-edge technology can be applied in the manufacturing industry, specifically to enhance quality control processes. By integrating these tools, we can significantly improve our ability to identify defects and pinpoint faulty products, thereby increasing efficiency and ensuring product reliability.

We are thankful for the presence of our fellow innovation enthusiasts who joined us yesterday evening.
Let's continue shaping the future of AI together!

üí´ Exciting news! I just released two new processors for MittaAI. The `jump_task` and `halt_task` node types will allow for greater control over the flow of our pipeline process. By using Jinja2, these processors can be used inside templates to control the pipeline flow. This means that an LLM can now control the pipeline flows when used with an `aidict` or `aistruct` processor.  I'll let that one sink in before talking more about it... #DAG

‚å® The next step is implementing a `call_task` processor, which will allow for a callback to be made directly to a given node in a pipeline. This will enable nodes that use callbacks internally (such as required in some AI services) to callback to the next node in the pipeline, allowing it to continue processing the same job without having to use separate pipelines. 

üöÄ My focus on building things that get people using the product in a low friction way has led me to these new developments. As always, I strive to treat myself as the first customer and continue to build features that improve the product. Thanks to everyone who reads these and supports me! üôè  #AI #pipeline #development

Generative AI is all the hype? We agree. But we have cautiously experimented this in Fr8labs for LogTech, and are amazed by what we can achieve and what this brings to the table for forwarders in terms of Growth Potential.

Didn't have time to watch our video? In summary, with natural language voice inputs, you can instruct our platform through an external chat medium to do all sorts of actions you would typically type into your system of record (like create a quotation, booking or create a shipment) or instruct your own internal operations teams to follow up on. Imagine the force multiplier effect this can have to your teams as they now switch their focus on work that truly matters.

How do you feel about AI in freight forwarding operations - excited or apprehensive?

2024 will be the year we come back down to earth about Generative AI and LLMs‚Ä¶.

I was honored to be invited to participate in a fireside chat, hosted by Enable focused around the hype surrounding Generative AI. It was a great way to conclude, what was a whirlwind AI year alongside esteemed  experts  Charlie Serotoff, Niels Meersschaert, and Paul Michael Clarke.

The past year showcased remarkable AI progress, occasionally causing some of us in the field a bit of AI whiplash.

2024 will be the year we shift focus from LLMs and Generative AI hype, and put effort to prepare our organizations to be able to truly grasp the value of this capability. 

While Generative AI crafting summaries, bullet points, slides, imagery, and videos is enjoyable and productivity-enhancing, the true value lies in less glamorous use cases.

Unlocking this value demands a laser focus on one crucial aspect‚Äîdata. And, organizations still struggle to get their data AI ready‚Ä¶.

2024 will be that year‚Ä¶.

To a year that shows continued advances in AI‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs just hope it‚Äôs a more measured pace of advancement.

For those that couldn't attend the fireside chat, take a read on the key takeaways here https://lnkd.in/dfptU4dA

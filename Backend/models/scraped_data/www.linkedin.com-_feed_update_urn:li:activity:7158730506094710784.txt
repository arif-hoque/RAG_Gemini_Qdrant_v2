Our CEO, Mosleh Uddin, just returned from the 7-day startup accelerator X-HUB TOKYO London program, in partnership with JETRO - Japan External Trade Organization and L Marks.

This program has provided invaluable support for Gigalogy's global expansion efforts, offering insights into the dynamic UK market. 
With London's thriving tech ecosystem and the UK's position as Europe's largest e-commerce market, the growth opportunities are immense.

Understanding the UK Market:

The UK stands as a beacon of innovation in e-commerce personalization, boasting a market size of ¬£160 billion, positioning itself as Europe's largest e-commerce market and the third-largest globally, following China and the US. 

London, in particular, serves as a nucleus for e-commerce companies, hosting 21 unicorns, including industry giants like FARFETCH, Depop, and ASOS.com. Its conducive business environment and robust connectivity fuel the growth of tech-savvy consumers, creating unparalleled opportunities for companies like Gigalogy.

Key Takeaways from London:

- In 2020, a staggering 87% of UK internet users engaged in online shopping, constituting 14.5% of global online retail sales.
- UK consumers exhibit advanced technological adoption, spending 82 billion hours on mobile shopping apps in 2020, marking a 30% increase from the previous year.
- With an annual expenditure of ¬£3,250 per shopper online, UK consumers outpace their global counterparts, underscoring the market's potential for growth and profitability.
- London's thriving tech ecosystem witnessed 75 unicorns raising a record $26 billion in funding in 2021, surpassing any other European capital.
- The city attracted $5 billion in venture capital investment in its e-commerce sector alone in 2021, positioning it as a formidable contender on the global stage.

Gigalogy's Next Chapter:

Fueled by these insights and connections, Gigalogy is gearing up for an exciting 2024:
- Forging Strategic Partnerships: We're actively seeking collaborations with key players in the UK to leverage their expertise and expand our reach.
- Building Investor Relations: We're committed to attracting investment that fuels our global growth ambitions.
